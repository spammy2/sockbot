# [SockBot](https://app.photop.live/?user=61c6c9b3e1e6417b595d3dfc)
A multi-purpose bot made for Photop using the npm photop-client package.

You can use this as an example of how to use photop-client to make a good bot.

As new features are added, photop-client will be updated accordingly, and so will SockBot.

Note this is written in typescript, so you will either have to compile it to javascript or learn a new language.
